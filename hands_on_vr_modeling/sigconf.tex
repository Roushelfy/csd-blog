\begin{abstract}
  We introduce VR-Doh, an open-source, hands-on 3D modeling system that enables intuitive creation and manipulation of elastoplastic objects in Virtual Reality (VR). By customizing the Material Point Method (MPM) for real-time simulation of hand-induced large deformations and enhancing 3D Gaussian Splatting for seamless rendering, VR-Doh provides an interactive and immersive 3D modeling experience. Users can naturally sculpt, deform, and edit objects through both contact- and gesture-based hand-object interactions.
  To achieve real-time performance, our system incorporates localized simulation techniques, particle-level collision handling, and the decoupling of physical and appearance representations, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions. VR-Doh supports both object creation and editing, enabling diverse modeling tasks such as designing food items, characters, and interlocking structures, all resulting in simulation-ready assets. User studies with both novice and experienced participants highlight the system's intuitive design, immersive feedback, and creative potential. Compared to existing geometric modeling tools, VR-Doh offers enhanced accessibility and natural interaction, making it a powerful tool for creative exploration in VR.

    \caption{The figure demonstrates the intuitive and versatile capabilities of our VR-Doh system. In the upper row, users deform the vase and refine the roses with tools and gestures. The lower row showcases the system's versatility, enabling seamless table deformation by hand contact, object removal, and vase placement. This workflow simplifies complex editing tasks, delivering realistic results efficiently and intuitively.
    %Top row: The vase is deformed using the VR-Doh system through contact-based hand-object interactions, followed by merging a bouquet of roses into the vase. Hand gestures are then used to bend and refine the roses, a process repeated across three stems. Bottom row: The garden scene is edited by removing the original vase, deforming the table with tools, and placing the newly decorated vase with roses as the centerpiece.
